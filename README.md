# Hunter
A discord server bot

A discord server is a great way of communication amongst the folks 🤓, but as the number of people increases ⬆️ there is a bombardment 🔥 of messages 📩 which becomes very difficult 😩 to go through and becomes a nightmare 😵 for a "busy person". Well the Hunter discord server bot comes to the rescue 😃, now there is no need for us to scroll through endless stream of messages 📦 but instead, a user can register for keywords of their choice and subscribe for certain types of events like a "question" or a "mention" in the messages or to seek "collaboration" with other folks. By doing that the user gets notified with a private message by the Hunter bot for the "keyword-subscription" combination he opted for 👌.
